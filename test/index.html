	<p>In this section we describe some commonly encountered crystal structures. Polonium (P0) is the only element having the simple cubic structure (cubic P in Fig. 8.10). The next simplest structures are the face centered cubic (cubic F in Fig. 8.10 and denoted fcc) and the body centered cubic (cubic I in Fig. 8.10 and denoted bcc), which are shown in Fig. 8.11(a,b). As examples, the elements Al, Cu, Ag, Au, and Ni adopt the fcc structure, while Fe, Ta, and Nb adopt the bee structure. In both cases the structures are also Bravais lattices. The fee lattice is :5 an example of what is called a close packed lattice, which we will further elaborate on. In a cubic basis there are four atoms per unit cell, while in the simplest rhombohedral Bravais lattice it will have one atom per cell. The bcc lattice is described in a cubic setting and has two atoms per unit cell.

Figure 8.12 shows two arrangements of the packing of spheres in three successive layers. The first layer correSponds to a hexagonal (triangular) array (as one has with racked pool balls). The second triangular layer rests on top of the first, but now the spheres nest into the "valleys" formed by the interstices of the first layer. The third layer may be placed into either of two non-equivalent sets of valleys. If the sphere centers are placed so that they fall over those of the first layer, and the structure is repeated so as to replicate the first two layers, we obtain a hexagonal close packed lattice. However if the spheres are placed so that they fall on the set of valleys not lying atop the first layer sphere centers, then we obtain, on repeating this three layer sequence, the face centered cubic lattice.
Calculation of the cohesive energy of metal usually involves a summation of the energies obtained from a band structure and an allowance for the effects of exchange correlation among the electrons. However, there is a simple model which works reasonably well for the alkali metals and which brings out the basic physics of metallic binding; this is the method of Wigner and Seitz, Which we now discuss.
We make the following assumptions: (1) we numerically calculate the energy of k = 0 state by assuming a core potential obtained from an atomic calculation and through applying a simple boundary condition to the wave function which approximates the required crystal boundary condition; (ii) the energies of the remaining states, between 0  k  kp, are obtained by adding the free electron energy (h*k/2m) to the k = 0 energy, and these energies are summed to obtain the total energy; and (iii) we assume that, since each unit cell contains only one electron, the effect of exchange and correlation need not be explicitly included.
We now discuss the calculation of the energy at k = 0. The k = 0 wave function has the full translational symmetry of the crystal. It follows that the wave function derivative in a direction normal to planes that bisect the vectors joining the nearest neighbors of the atom must vanish; these planes from a polyhedron. Figure 7.9 shows the corners of the body centered cubic lattice of the alkali metals and the associated polyhedron. As an approximate boundary condition, Wigner and Seitz replaced this polyhedron with a sphere of radius R with an equivalent volume which requires AAA.
